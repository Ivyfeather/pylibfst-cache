# pylibfst: Handle *Fast Signal Traces* (fst) in Python

Pylibfst is mainly a python cffi wrapper for libfst (*Fast Signal Trace*) from [gtkwave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/).

FST is like [VCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_change_dump) is an open format for dumpfiles generated by EDA logic simulation tools.
Unlike VCD, FST is a binary format that offers much better performance for very large dumpfiles.
FST was developed as part of gtkwave.
For more details on the format, see [GTKWave 3.3 Wave Analyzer User's Guide](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/gtkwave.pdf).
